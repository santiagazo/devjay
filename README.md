# DevJay

Welcome to my personal website! This project is designed to showcase my skills in front-end development, user interface design, and infrastructure automation. It is built with **React** and **Vite** for a fast and modern development experience, and is structured to impress potential employers with both its code quality and deployability.

---

## Purpose

The primary goal of this website is to:

1. **Architect a balanced solution**: Satisfying the primary use cases of **Get to know Jay**, **Contact Jay** while balancing time constraints, budget, learning, and more, utilize UML Architecture to provide an appropriate solution.
2. **Test Driven Development**: Tests supporting the primary use cases derived from architecture ensure our code adhears to policy, SOLID principals, and maintainability.
3. **Demonstrate my coding skills**: Clean, modular, and maintainable code using modern JavaScript (ES6+), and eventually C#, NodeJS, and PHP.
2. **Showcase my design abilities**: An intuitive and visually appealing graphical user interface.
3. **Highlight my infrastructure expertise**: The site is deployable using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), ensuring productivity, reproducibility, and scalability.
